## I'm Nicholas Fehlberg... thanks for stopping by

I'm a front end developer with a professional background in e-commerce, graphic design and marketing

🔭  I’m currently learning full stack web/app development

🌱  I’m enrolled at LaTrobe doing a Bachelor's Degree in IT, and the Coder Academy Bootcamp in Melbourne, AU

💬  I'm interested in human-machine interaction and IoT devices. If we're going to have Skynet, let's make sure we can control it

⚡   Fun fact: I'm a guitarist and lover of 80's music and I've driven over 500k miles around the United States
