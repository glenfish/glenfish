I'm a web developer with a professional background in e-commerce, graphic design and marketing

🔭  Currently expanding my skills in full stack web/app development

🌱  I’m bootcamping with Coder Academy in Melbourne, AU

💬  Interested in human-machine interaction and IoT devices. If we're going to have Skynet, let's make sure we can control it

⚡   Useless facts: I'm a guitarist, a lover of 80's music and I've driven over 500k miles around the United States in a big rig. Collecting and modding mechanical keyboards and building computers are good ways to spend money and waste time. But I do them anyway.

Everything is better after coffee.
