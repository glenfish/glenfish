## I'm Nicholas Fehlberg... thanks for stopping by

I'm a web developer with a professional background in e-commerce, graphic design and marketing

🔭  Currently expanding my skills in full stack web/app development

🌱  I’m bootcamping with Coder Academy in Melbourne, AU

💬  Interested in human-machine interaction and IoT devices. If we're going to have Skynet, let's make sure we can control it

⚡   Fun fact: I'm a guitarist and lover of 80's music and I've driven over 500k miles around the United States. Making Italian style coffee and collecting and modding mechanical keyboards are a couple of my hobbies.
