## I'm Nicholas Fehlberg... thanks for stopping in

I'm a developer with a professional background in e-commerce, graphic design and marketing

I grew up with the Commodore 64 and TRS 80. My grandfather taught me about hexadecimal when I was 10, although I had no idea why representing numbers as letters was a good idea at the time. He started writing DOS programs in his retirement years - so cool! I've been a professional developer since 2007 and created some interesting marketing/tracking related programs.

🔭  Currently expanding my skills in full stack web/app development

🌱  I’m bootcamping with Coder Academy in Melbourne, AU

💬  Interested in human-machine interaction and IoT devices. If we're going to have Skynet, let's make sure we can control it

⚡   Fun fact: I'm a guitarist and lover of 80's music and I've driven over 500k miles around the United States
