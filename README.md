My name is Nicholas Fehlberg aka glenfish and I'm a full stack web developer, currently expanding my skills with Coder Academy in Australia

💬   Im interested in systems that empower people and forms of commerce and interaction that benefit individuals and small communities.

⚡   Useless facts: I'm a guitarist, a lover of 80's music and I've driven over 500k miles around the United States in a big rig. Collecting and modding mechanical keyboards and building gaming PC's are good ways to spend money and waste time. But I do them anyway.

☕ Life is better with coffee.
